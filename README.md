# Battleships

I have built this game to mimic the old classic game 'Battleships'. the game has been designed to allow the player to interact though the termianl and play against the computer. The game generates a 6x6 playing board for the player and cpmputer and randomizes the ship positions each game. The player will then guess a row and column each round which is followed by the computers guess. The game continues until either the player or computer sinks the opponents ships. The Player also has the option to quit the game after each turn. 

The game has been created for my third Code Institute portfolio project and is a Python based program. The Battleships site is live and can be found by clicking [here](https://battleships-cd-aee01aae76c3.herokuapp.com/)
